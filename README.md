# Deep learning project
This is the project for the deep learning course at University of Trento (Italy).  
## Data
The project exploits video surveillance data, more precisely the Market1501 dataset. 
## Brief introduction
This work consists of two main tasks: 
* Design and implementation of a multi task classifier for attribute classification (age, gender and clothing).  
* Person re-identification, given a query image the goal is to retrieve all the images of the same person from the dataset.  
***
This repo contains:
* The colab notebooks.
* The report.
